<span class="small_font">üëãüèº Hello there, I am Malay Joshi. I am an <b>AI Engineer at Wow Internet Labz</b> located at Bangalore, India. Here I am working with teams across multiple domains on different stages of development of <b>GenAI-based (vision and text) products</b> for some of the most prominent enterprises around the globe. 

In 2023, I received my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from AKGEC, Uttar Pradesh. My thesis project on <b>‚ÄúDRISHTI: Visual Navigation Assistant for Visually Impaired‚Äù</b> was advised by Prof. Suvarna Mujumdar and Prof. Himanshu Tripathi and supported by <b>FabLab, AKGEC Campus</b>.

During the summers of 2022, I spent a wonderful time by being part of <b>Google Summer of Code</b> and working with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/andres-becerra-sandoval/">Andr√©s Becerra Sandoval</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PLWzrw8AAAAJ&hl=en">Valerio Arnaboldi</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/mz3%40sanger.ac.uk">Magdalena Zarowiecki</a> to contribute to BioNLP-based open-source project at <b>EMBL-EBI, United Kingdom</b>. My other stints includes opportunity to intern at <b>DESIDOC-DRDO</b> (with <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-QAY-S0AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Mohd Yousuf Ansari</a>), <b>Dubverse</b> (with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varshul/">Varshul Gupta</a>), <b>Wow Labz</b> (with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/startupamit/">Amit Singh</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunsays/">Varun Gyanchandani</a>) and <b>Erevna</b>(with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhanshuchauhan/">Prabhanshu Chauhan</a>). Most of my explorations and learnings about various sub-domains of AI has been done through these opportunities only.

<h3>Research Interest</h3>

<span class="small_font">My current research interests lie at the intersection of <b>Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing & Generation</b>. I really love to see technology from its feasibility and impact while being used as a product/system by the users. Now I am gradually moving towards theoretical aspect of technology as well to make it more personalized, efficient and adopted by mass. My goal is to keep this exploration of knowing technology in-depth and use it to develop much better visual and textual information processing products/solutions which could be used to <b>assist and entertain</b> the society!</span>

> __*I am currently looking for opportunities to pursue research and development in a similar field with applications open to enterprise-level conversational systems, marketing campaigns content generators, sales intelligence solutions, and enterprise-level productivity tools.*__
