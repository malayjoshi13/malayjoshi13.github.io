<span class="small_font">üëãüèº Hello there, I am Malay Joshi.I am a first-year <b>Ph.D. at the CSAIL, MIT</b> advised by Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/">Pulkit Agrawal</a>. I am supported by the <b>Ida Green Fellowship</b>. I am grateful to have been advised by some of the most amazing researchers, including Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/">C V Jawahar</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://vinaypn.github.io/">Vinay Namboodiri</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/">K. Madhav Krishna</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/">Srinath Sridhar</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://liampaull.ca/">Liam Paull</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/">Florian Shkurti</a>.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was also a <b>Data Scientist at Microsoft</b>. I led the recommendation and suggestion team for the world's biggest enterprise-facing email client - Outlook. These features are used by more than 100 million users per month!
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Creative Outlet.</b> I am a musician. I sing and play guitar. I have toured and performed at several places with my previous band, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AndroMetaBand">Andrometa</a>. I also LOVE traveling and used to create travel vlogs and music covers on YouTube! My <b>brother</b> is an amazing pianist and has taken over the channel now: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU1TMnEt0J1UJZfMW1Gixgg?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">Insen: Outdoor Pianist</a>. 

<h3>Research Interest</h3>

<span class="small_font">My interest lies at the intersection of <b>3D computer vision and Robotics</b>. Specifically, I am interested in designing improved representations of the 3D world to enable embodied agents acquire a holistic view of the world. This way, an agent can make better-informed control decisions for achieving a given downstream goal, for example, manipulation or autonomous navigation. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Today, most works rely on explicit representation forms like pointclouds or voxel-based representations. But they are limiting in many ways - they are high dimensional, discrete, and, most importantly, incomplete -- they do not sense the underlying structure and only capture explicit values at specific locations. I am more interested in <b>implicit representations</b> of the world and how to design improved task-specific representations. Ultimately, I am excited to see embodied AI become a part of the real world and seamlessly integrate with humans!</span>
