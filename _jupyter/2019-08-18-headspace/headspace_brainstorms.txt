- being overly excited about new boy --> can't focus at work
- being sad about new boy --> letting grief through and letting it go
- feeling lots of feelings after fancy lady talk --> fear of not being good enough to get that --> that's a silly fear, let it go
- preparing for a big talk --> worked for two of them (didn't work for one, mostly)
- frisbee recovery --> seems to actually work
- angry at academia --> stopped being so angry

thinking about disappointing boy, brain immediately went to very
negative stormy thoughts. recognized it *so quickly*,
decided to let it go (and, as a bonus, brain then
went to the happy thoughts we had!)
